# Wrangle yo' data

## Announcements

### Comments on assignments

- Great job overall!

__Worksheet__: You can find the worksheet template for today
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USF-Psych-DataSci/Classroom/master/tutorials/s04_data-wrangling-exercise.Rmd).


## Today's Topics

Today we'll get started with learning to "wrangle" data—that is, to subset it, 
rearrange it, transform it, summarize it, and otherwise make it ready for 
analysis. We are going to be working with the [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) 
package. Specifically, we're going to consider three lessons today:

- Intro to `dplyr` syntax
- The `%>%` pipe and the `dplyr` advantage
- `filter`; relational/comparison and logical operators in R

- Specific `dplyr` functions we will cover
  - `select()`
  - `arrange()`
  - `filter()`
  - `mutate()`
  - `summarize()`
  - `group_by()`
      - grouped `mutate()`
      - grouped `summarize()`
  - `across()`
  - `rowwise()`
  - `recode()`

## Intro to `dplyr` syntax

### Learning Objectives

Here are the concepts we'll be exploring in this lesson:

- tidyverse
- `dplyr` functions:
    - select
    - arrange
- piping

By the end of this lesson, students are expected to be able to:

- subset and rearrange data with `dplyr`
- use piping (`%>%`) when implementing function chains

### Preamble

Let's talk about:

- The history of `dplyr`: `plyr`
  - Don't use both in one script!
  - My recommendation, don't use `plyr` at all at this point.
- tibbles are a special type of data frame
- The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- Package functions and masking
  - Load the `tidyverse` package: `library(tidyverse)`

### Demonstration

Let's get started with the exercise:

1. Open the `s04_data-wrangling-exercise.Rmd` worksheet in RStudio.
2. Follow along in the `.Rmd` file until the *Back to Guide* section.


## The `dplyr` advantage

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

- Have a sense of why `dplyr` is advantageous compared to the "base R" way with respect to good coding practice.

Why?

- Having this in the back of your mind will help you identify qualities of and produce a readable analysis.

### Compare base R to `dplyr`

__Self-documenting code__. 

This is where the tidyverse shines.

Example of `dplyr` vs base R:

```
gapminder[gapminder$country == "Cambodia", c("year", "lifeExp")]
```

vs.

```
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Cambodia") %>%
  select(year, lifeExp)
```

### The workflow:

1. Wrangle your data with `dplyr` first
2. Pipe `%>%` your data into a plot/analysis

### Basic principles:

1. Do one thing at a time
  - Transform variables OR select variables OR filter cases
2. Chain multiple operations together using the pipe `%>%` 
3. Use readable object and variable names
4. Subset a dataset (i.e., select variables) by **name**, not by "magic numbers"
5. _Note that you need to use the assignment operator `<-` to store changes!_

### Tangent: Base R workflow

- We are jumping right into the tidyverse way of doing things in R, instead of the base R way of doing things. Our first week was about "just enough" base R to get you started. If you feel that you want more practice here, take a look at [the R intro stat videos by MarinStatsLectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqzoL9-eJTNARFXxgwbqGo56NtbJnB37A).


## Relational/Comparison and Logical Operators in R

### Learning Objectives

Here are the concepts we'll be exploring in this lesson:

- Relational/comparison operators
- Logical operators
- `dplyr` functions:
    - filter
    - mutate

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Predict the output of R code containing the above operators.
- Explain the difference between `&`/`&&` and `|`/`||`, and name a situation 
  where one should be used over the other.
- Subsetting and transforming data using filter and mutate

### R Operators

**Arithmetic** operators allow us to carry out mathematical operations:

| Operator | Description |
|------|:---------|
| + | Add |
| - | Subtract |
| * | Multiply |
| / | Divide |
| ^ | Exponent |
| %/% | Integer division |
| %% | Modulus (remainder from integer division) |

**Relational** operators allow us to compare values:

| Operator | Description |
|------|:---------|
| < | Less than |
| > | Greater than |
| <= | Less than or equal to |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |
| == | Equal to |
| != | Not equal to |

* Arithmetic and relational operators work on vectors.

There is another very useful relational function, `%in%`:

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) %in% c(1, 2)
```

**Logical** operators allow us to carry out boolean operations:

| Operator | Description |
|---|:---|
| ! | Not |
| \| | Or (element_wise) |
| & | And (element-wise) |
| \|\| | Or |
| && | And |

* The difference between `|` and `||` is that `||` evaluates only the first 
element of the two vectors, whereas `|` evaluates element-wise.

## Picking up where we left off

__Worksheet__: You can find the worksheet template for today
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USF-Psych-DataSci/Classroom/master/tutorials/s05_data-wrangling-exercise_part-2.Rmd).

## `summarize()`

Like `mutate()`, the `summarize()` function also creates new columns, but the 
calculations that make the new columns must reduce down to a single number. 

For example, let's compute the mean and standard deviation of life expectancy 
in the gapminder data set:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  summarize(mu    = mean(lifeExp),
            sigma = sd(lifeExp))
```

Notice that all other columns were dropped. This is necessary, because there's 
no obvious way to compress the other columns down to a single row. This is 
unlike `mutate()`, which keeps all columns, and more like `transmute()`, which 
drops all other columns.

As it is, this is hardly useful. (Though it is useful for creating Table 1 in 
your papers.) But summarizing is more useful in the context of _grouping_, 
coming up next.


## `group_by()`

The true power of `dplyr` lies in its ability to group a tibble, with the 
`group_by()` function. As usual, this function takes in a tibble and returns a 
(grouped) tibble. 

Let's group the gapminder dataset by continent and year:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent, year)
```

The only thing different from a regular tibble is the indication of grouping 
variables above the tibble. This means that the tibble is recognized as having 
"chunks" defined by unique combinations of continent and year:

- Asia in 1952 is one chunk.
- Asia in 1957 is another chunk.
- Europe in 1952 is another chunk.
- etc...

Notice that the data frame isn't _rearranged_ by chunk! The grouping is something
stored internally about the grouped tibble.

Now that the tibble is grouped, operations that you do on a grouped tibble 
_will be done independently within each chunk_, as if no other chunks exist. 

You can also create new variables and group by that variable simultaneously. 
Try splitting life expectancy by "small" and "large" using 60 as a threshold:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(smallLifeExp = lifeExp < 60)
```

### Grouped `summarize()`

Want to compute the mean and standard deviation for each year for every 
continent? No problem:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  summarize(mu    = mean(lifeExp),
            sigma = sd(lifeExp))
```

Notice:

- The grouping variables are kept in the tibble, because their values are unique 
  within each chunk (by definition of the chunk!)
- With each call to `summarize()`, the grouping variables are "peeled back" from 
  last grouping variable to first.

This means the above tibble is now only grouped by continent. What happens when 
we reverse the grouping?

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year, continent) %>%    # Different order
  summarize(mu    = mean(lifeExp),
            sigma = sd(lifeExp))
```

The grouping columns are switched, and now the tibble is grouped by year instead 
of continent. 

`dplyr` has a bunch of convenience functions that help us write code more 
eloquently. We could use `group_by()` and `summarize()` with `length()` to find 
the number of entries each country has:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  transmute(n = length(country))
```

Or, we can use the more elegant `dplyr::n()` to count the number of rows in each 
group:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(n = n())
```

Or better yet, if this is all we want, just use `dplyr::count()`:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  count(country)
```

### Grouped `mutate()`

Want to get the increase in GDP per capita for each country? No problem:

```{r}
gap_inc <- gapminder %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(gdpPercap_inc = gdpPercap - lag(gdpPercap))
print(gap_inc)
```

The tibble is still grouped by country.

Drop the `NA`s with another convenience function, this time supplied by the 
`tidyr` package (another tidyverse package that we'll see soon):

```{r}
gap_inc %>% 
  tidyr::drop_na()
```

You can specify specific columns to drop `NA`s from in the `drop_na()` function.

## Function types

We've seen cases of transforming variables using `mutate()` and `summarize()`, 
both with and without `group_by()`. How can you know what combination to use? 
Here's a summary based on one of three types of functions.


| Function type | Explanation | Examples | In `dplyr` |
|------|-----|----|----|
| Vectorized functions | These take a *vector*, and operate on each component independently to return a vector of the same length. In other words, they work element-wise. | `cos()`, `sin()`, `log()`, `exp()`, `round()` | `mutate()` |
| Aggregate functions | These take a vector, and return a vector of length 1 | `mean()`, `sd()`, `length()` | `summarize()`, esp with `group_by()`. |
| Window Functions | these take a vector, and return a vector of the same length that depends on the vector as a whole. | `lag()`, `rank()`, `cumsum()` | `mutate()`, esp with `group_by()` |


## `recode()`

`recode()` is useful for recoding categorical variables.

Unlike most of the other function in `dplyr`, `recode()` is backwards in it's syntax:

```
recode(.x, old = new)
```
Lets take a look at recoding different variables using the `psychTools::bfi` dataset:

In the dataset, our `gender` variable has values 1 and 2.

This is a little vague since we don't know what 1 or 2 is in respect to gender.

```{r}
dat_bfi <- psychTools::bfi %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = ".id")

dat_bfi %>%
  mutate(
    gender = recode(gender, "1" = "man", "2" = "woman")
  ) %>%
  select(.id, gender, education)
```

*Note that for numeric values, you need to wrap them in "quotes" or `backticks`; however, that's not necessary for character values*

We can also specify a `.default` value within our `recode()`.

For example, say we want to have just "HS or less" versus "more than HS"

```{r}
dat_bfi %>%
  mutate(
    education = recode(education, "1" = "HS", "2" = "HS", .default = "More than HS")
  ) %>%
  select(.id, gender, education)
```

Another neat feature of the `recode()` function is the `.missing` value.

If we would rather convert NA values to something more explicit we can specify that in the `.missing` argument.

```{r}
dat_bfi %>%
  mutate(
    education = recode(education, "1" = "HS", "2" = "HS", .default = "More than HS", .missing = "(Unknown)")
  ) %>%
  select(.id, gender, education)
```

Or we can use `tidyr::replace_na()` 

```{r}
dat_bfi %>%
  mutate(
    education = replace_na(education, replace = "(Unknown)")
  ) %>%
  select(.id, gender, education)
```


## `across()`

The `across` function allows us to apply transformations across multiple columns

Say we wanted to look at the mean of each agreeable variable between gender groups:

```{r}
dat_bfi %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarize(
    across(
      A1:A5,
      ~ mean(.x, na.rm = T)
    )
  )
```

What if we wanted to include the standard deviation as well? We can pass a `list` of functions into `across()`

```{r}
dat_bfi %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarize(
    across(
      A1:A5,
      list(
     mean = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = T),
     sd = ~ sd(.x, na.rm = T)
      )
    )
  )
```

### Complex `recoding` & `across()`

Now sometimes with our scales we may encounter variables that are reverse scored.

```{r}
dat_bfi %>%
  mutate(A1r = recode(A1, "6" = 1, "5" = 2, "4" = 3, "3" = 4, "2" = 5, "1" = 6)) %>%
  select(A1, A1r)

# or

dat_bfi %>%
  mutate(A1r = 7 - A1) %>%
  select(A1, A1r)
```

However, we can implement some more complex code that will reverse `recode()` in one fell swoop!

We start with either specifying our columns that need reverse coding or get it from a data dictionary:

```{r}
reversed <- c("A1", "C4", "C5", "E1", "E2", "O2", "O5")

# or

dict <- psychTools::bfi.dictionary %>%
  as_tibble(rownames = "item")

reversed <- dict %>%
  filter(Keying == -1) %>%
  pull(item)
```

Putting it all together: 

```{r}
dat_bfi %>%
  mutate(
    across(all_of(reversed),
      ~ recode(.x, "6" = 1, "5" = 2, "4" = 3, "3" = 4, "2" = 5, "1" = 6),
      .names = "{.col}r"
    )
  )
```

*Note that we can use the `.names` argument to aid in the naming of our new columns*

## `rowwise()`

The `rowwise()` function lets us look at the data frame one row-at-a-time and apply functions as such.

Looking back at `dat_bfi`, say we wanted to get the total score of our scales per response:

```{r}
dat_bfi %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  summarise(
    .id = .id,
    A_sum = sum(c_across(A1:A5)),
    C_sum = sum(c_across(C1:C5)),
    E_sum = sum(c_across(E1:E5)),
    N_sum = sum(c_across(N1:N5)),
    O_sum = sum(c_across(O1:O5))
  )
```

## `dplyr` Exercises

Let's go to the worksheet and work on the exercises.
