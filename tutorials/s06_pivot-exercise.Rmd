## Exercise 1: Univariate Pivoting

Consider the Lord of the Rings data:

```{r}
lotr
```

1. Widen the data so that we see the words spoken by each species, by putting each species as its own column.

```{r}
(lotr_wide <- lotr %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(Film, Gender), 
              names_from = Species, 
              values_from = Words))
```

2. Re-lengthen the wide LOTR data from Question 2 above.

```{r}
lotr_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Elf:Man), 
               names_to  = "species", 
               values_to = "words_spoken")
```
